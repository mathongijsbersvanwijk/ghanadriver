                view destinations which many drivers have cited as important. InDriver is reported to take driver commissions of about 5% to 8%. It is a 
                five-year-old Russian ride-hailing service, already launched in Tanzania and Kenya and now expanding to Ghana.</p>

                <p>A typical Uber driver makes 30 hours per week. We estimate that the average trip for a driver yields 16 Ghana cedi.
                Since drivers usually complete two full trips per hour, this adds up to an hourly earning total of 32 cedi, making the total per week
                going up to 1000 cedi. Uber charges 25% commission. And the driver is responsible for all expenses.</p>
